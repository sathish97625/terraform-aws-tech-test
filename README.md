# AWS Terraform Exercise
# Test
This has been tested using Terraform v0.12.x we advise you use this version as we will test your code with the same.

Upload your solution to a forked Git repository. Document your solution and notes on how to run it in a `NOTES.md` markdown file and include it in the root directory with this `README.md`.

Here we have some Terraform which builds a simple VPC. For now, we have just one instance running the web server Nginx in its default configuration, serving up the default welcome page.

To run terraform use the following command:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=dublin.tfvars
```

Complete all exercises, making sure to use git appropriately. Feel free to modify and refactor the existing code in order to best achieve your solution. Please use AWS and Terraform best practices in order to complete your solution - which can be easily readable.

Please can you make sure that you tag your AWS resources with the following key/values:
- Owner : <your_name>
- Project : Tech Test

VPC CIDR blocks to choose from:
- 10.10.10.0/24 (default in dublin.tfvars)
- 10.10.20.0/24
- 10.10.30.0/24

Exercises:

1. The EC2 instance running Nginx went down over the weekend and we had an outage, it's been decided that we need a solution that is more resilient. Please implement a solution that demonstrates best practice resilience within a single region.

2. We would like to be able to run the same stack closer to our customers in the US. Please build the same stack in the us-east-1 (Virginia) region. Note that Virginia has a different number of availability zones which we would like to take advantage of for better resilience. As for a CIDR block for the VPC use whatever you feel like, providing it's compliant with RFC-1918 and does not overlap with the dublin network.

3. We are looking to improve the security of our network and have decided we need a bastion server to avoid logging on directly to our servers. Add a bastion server, the bastion should be the only route to SSH onto servers in the VPC.

4. We are looking for a Python3 Lambda function which writes the state of the instance(s) from the previous solution to a DynamoDB table every hour, and nothing on the table should be older than a day.
